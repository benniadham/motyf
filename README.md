Easy, powerful and safe programming language.

## Fundamental Concept
1. `M0tyf` stands for modules, types and functions. Programming in `M0tyf` basically designing data types, defining actions in functions and packaging all of them in modules.
2. `M0tyf` should provides expressiveness for abstraction with low overhead introduced to the hardware requirements. This means that user   is enabled to write a high level abstraction which would generate code that is so efficient as if it was written closely to the hardware.
3. `M0tyf` should be easy to use for any one with any level of programming proficiency. It should be easy for new user to adopt quickly as if it is a high level    language, and at the same time it discourages and prevents novice programmer to write bad codes.
4. `M0tyf` as a framework should be open for experienced user while at the same time promotes good code, i.e. advance memory efficient code as if an experienced user wrote it or prevents bad ones to avoid common errors and crashes.
5. `M0tyf` should come with a full set of build tools, documentation and package manager which allow user to share modules in binaries or source code for easy code sharing, deployment and maintenance. 
6. `M0tyf` should be compatible with system library which means it should be binary compatible with C libraries and operating systems library. Calling system calls should be a native capability in `M0tyf`.
